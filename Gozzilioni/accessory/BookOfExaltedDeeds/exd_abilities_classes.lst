Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Apostles of peace gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect them (such as a Ring of Protection or Bracers of Armor). An apostle of peace who wears any armor is unable to cast apostle of peace spells or use any of his supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace has the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an apostle with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Apostle of peace bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the apostle of peace's Wisdom modifier. When the apostle of peace gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 2nd-level spells for a 2nd-level apostle), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The apostle of peace's spell list appears below. An apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does. To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace, add the character's apostle levels to one-half of his caster levels in other spellcasting classes.

Spontaneous Casting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the apostle did not prepare ahead of time. An apostle can "lose" any prepared apostle spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

Turn Undead	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace can turn undead as a good cleric of his apostle of peace level would.

Pacifying Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains the ability to pacify hostile or angry creatures by touch. The effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch the target. A touched creature receives no saving throw and spell resistance does not apply. The pacifying touch does not suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic, using his character level as his caster level, to dispel certain mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target, such as fear or rage.

Censure Fiends	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 4rd-level apostle of peace can censure fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils, and other outsiders with the evil subtype recoil. Make a Charisma check for the apostle and consult Table 8-9 in the Player's Handbook, using the apostle's character level to determine the most powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6 + the apostle of peace's level + his Charisma modifier for censuring damage. Using both the apostle's character level and his class level in this manner means that he is more likely to affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to censure more than one of them. A censured fiend is stunned by the apostle's holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apostle of peace attacks a censured fiend, the stunning ends immediately and the fiend can act normally on its next turn. If the apostle of peace's character level is at least twice the fiend's Hit Dice, he banishes the affected fiend back to its home plane. An apostle of peace can make a number of censuring attempts per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. These attempts are separate from any attempts to turn undead.

Defensive Stance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DefenderOfSealtielFeatures.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:When he needs to, a defender of Sealtiel can become a stalwart bastion of defense. In this defensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender of Sealtiel's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position, such as Move Silently or Jump. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level. Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action. (A defender can't, for example, use the stance when struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the increased Constitution.)

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmissaryOfBarachielFeatures.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An emissary of Barachiel has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast an emissary of Barachiel spell, the emissary must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an emissary with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Emissary of Barachiel bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the emissary's Charisma modifier. When the emissary gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level emissary of Barachiel), he gets only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The emissary's spell list appears below. An emissary of Barachiel casts spells just as a bard does, except that his spells are divine and not arcane.

Calling	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmissaryOfBarachielFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An emissary of Barachiel's most fundamental ability is the power to issue a celestial call, stirring the conscience of those who hear it. An emissary can use this ability once per day per class level, spending a full-round action to issue the call. Humanoid creatures within 30 feet of the emissary are potentially affected. The emissary makes a Diplomacy check, and the result is the DC for affected creatures' Will saving throws. Creatures that fail their saves suffer effects that depend on their alignment, as tables indicate. Using any manifestation of the calling class ability requires the use of the Words of Creation and deals 3d4 points of nonlethal damage to the emissary. Calling is an Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting] effect.

Convert	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.EmissaryOfBarachielFeatures.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 3rd-level emissary of Barachiel can use his calling ability to facilitate actual conversion of nongood humanoids. Doing so counts as a use of the calling class ability (see above) for the day, and the initial effects of the calling are the same-except that the emissary takes 5d4 points of nonlethal damage instead of 3d4. When the initial effects are over, however, all creatures that were subject to any effect of the calling (except lawful good creatures) must make another saving throw. Creatures who fail begin acting as though their alignment were one step closer to good. Lawful evil creatures act lawful neutral, neutral evil creatures act neutral, and chaotic evil creatures act chaotic neutral. Lawful neutral and neutral good creatures act lawful good. True neutral and chaotic good creatures act neutral good, and chaotic neutral creatures act chaotic good. Creatures affected by this temporary alignment shift can make new saving throws each day for a total of seven days. If the emissary is not present at the time a creature makes its save, it receives a +1 circumstance bonus on the saving throw, and this bonus increases by 1 for each additional saving throw for which the emissary is not present. During these seven days, an affected creature is immune to any other conversion effect, from the same emissary or a different one. During this time, the alignment shift can be reversed with a break enchantment spell, but the caster must succeed on a caster level check against a DC equal to the emissary's original Diplomacy check result. Also during this time, an atonement spell can make the alignment shift permanent, preventing the creature from making any additional saving throws. If a creature fails seven saving throws after the initial saving throw against the calling, the alignment change is permanent. At this point, the creature can change alignment again, either through another conversion effect, or voluntarily (in a gradual manner, as alignment change normally works-the creature cannot simply decide to be evil again).
