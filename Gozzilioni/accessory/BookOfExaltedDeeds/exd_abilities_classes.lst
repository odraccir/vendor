Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Apostles of peace gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect them (such as a Ring of Protection or Bracers of Armor). An apostle of peace who wears any armor is unable to cast apostle of peace spells or use any of his supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.	KEY:Apostole of Peace ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency																										SORTKEY:Class_Apostole_Of_Peace	SOURCEPAGE:ExD	
Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace has the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an apostle with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Apostle of peace bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the apostle of peace's Wisdom modifier. When the apostle of peace gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 2nd-level spells for a 2nd-level apostle), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The apostle of peace's spell list appears below. An apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does. To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace, add the character's apostle levels to one-half of his caster levels in other spellcasting classes.	KEY:Apostole of Peace ~ Spellcasting																										SORTKEY:Class_Apostole_Of_Peace	SOURCEPAGE:ExD	
Spontaneous Casting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the apostle did not prepare ahead of time. An apostle can "lose" any prepared apostle spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

Turn Undead	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:An apostle of peace can turn undead as a good cleric of his apostle of peace level would. If he is also a cleric (or paladin), he adds his apostle levels to his effective cleric levels to determine his turning capability.

Pacifying Touch	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains the ability to pacify hostile or angry creatures by touch. The effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch the target. A touched creature receives no saving throw and spell resistance does not apply. The pacifying touch does not suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic, using his character level as his caster level, to dispel certain mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target, such as fear or rage.	KEY:Apostole of Peace ~ Pacifying Touch																										SORTKEY:Class_Apostole_Of_Peace	SOURCEPAGE:ExD	
Censure Fiends	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ApostoleOfPeaceClassFeatures.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 4rd-level apostle of peace can censure fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils, and other outsiders with the evil subtype recoil. Make a Charisma check for the apostle and consult Table 8-9 in the Player's Handbook, using the apostle's character level to determine the most powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6 + the apostle of peace's level + his Charisma modifier for censuring damage. Using both the apostle's character level and his class level in this manner means that he is more likely to affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to censure more than one of them. A censured fiend is stunned by the apostle's holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apostle of peace attacks a censured fiend, the stunning ends immediately and the fiend can act normally on its next turn. If the apostle of peace's character level is at least twice the fiend's Hit Dice, he banishes the affected fiend back to its home plane. An apostle of peace can make a number of censuring attempts per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. These attempts are separate from any attempts to turn undead.

Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BelovedOfValarianClassFeatures	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A beloved of Valarian has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a beloved of Valarian spell, the beloved must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a beloved of Valarian with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Beloved of Valarian bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the beloved's Wisdom modifier. When the beloved of Valarian gets 0 spells of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st level beloved of Valarian), she gets only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The beloved of Valarian's spell list appears below. A beloved of Valarian prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Call Unicorn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BelovedOfValarianClassFeatures.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A beloved of Valarian can call a unicorn to her side. See the Monster Manual for the unicorn's statistics. The unicorn appears instantly and serves the character for life, provided she remains chaste and of good alignment. The unicorn may be dismissed at any time, although a character cannot call another until she gains a level in the beloved of Valarian class.

Ethereal Jaunt	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.BelovedOfValarianClassFeatures.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At 2nd level, once per day, a beloved of Valarian and her equipment may become ethereal, as the Ethereal Jaunt spell cast by a sorcerer of the beloved's character level.
