This feat has no effect on hit point damage or ability damage.																	SOURCEPAGE:PFSrd			
Heroic Recovery	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES				PREFEAT:2,Diehard,Endurance														PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=4				SAB:Once per day as a standard action you may attempt a new saving throw against a harmful condition or affliction requiring a Fortitude save that is affecting you.

You cannot use this feat to recover from instantaneous effects, effects that do not allow a saving throw, or effects that do not require a Fortitude save.																	SOURCEPAGE:PFSrd

Agile Maneuvers	TYPE:General	VISIBLE:YES																						SAB:You've learned to use your quickness in place of brute force when performing combat maneuvers.

You lose the benefits of this feat if you carry a medium or heavy load.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE											BONUS:MOVEADD|TYPE.Walk|5|PREVARLT:ENCUMBERANCE,1,var("COUNT[EQTYPE.ARMOR.EQUIPPED.IS.MEDIUM]"),1,var("COUNT[EQTYPE.ARMOR.EQUIPPED.IS.HEAVY]"),1			SOURCEPAGE:PFSrd			
Sickening Spell	TYPE:Metamagic.Wizard	VISIBLE:YES																						SAB:You can sicken creatures with your spells. You can modify a spell to sicken a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the sickening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become sickened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added on to the duration of the spell. A sickening spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.
