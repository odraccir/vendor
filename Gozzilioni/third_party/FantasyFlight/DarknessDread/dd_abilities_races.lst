Babbling Madness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CacklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A cackling perceptor makes strange, gibbering sounds that resemble a madman’s laughter. Any creature that comes within 60 ft. of one of these monsters must make a Will save (DC %1) or act as if under the effects of confusion for 2d10 rounds. This noise results from the perceptor’s attempts to communicate with other beings. Their cosmic insight into the nature of reality allows them to alter and manipulate the psyches of other creatures with sound, though there is no apparent reason or order in the actions they compel others to commit. This is a mind-influencing effect.|BabblingMadnessDC	KEY:Cackling Perceptor ~ Babbling Madness				DEFINE:BabblingMadnessDC|0					BONUS:VAR|BabblingMadnessDC|DefaultDCCon	BONUS:VAR|BabblingMadnessDC|2|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Ability Focus (Babbling Madness)								ABILITY:Ability Focus|AUTOMATIC|Babbling Madness									SOURCEPAGE:DD
Cosmic Awareress	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CacklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The perceptor’s supernatural insight into the material world makes it almost impossible to take by surprise. It sees into time, space, emotion, and other dimensions that humans cannot fathom. It counts as taking 20 in all Listen and Spot checks and its sight and hearing extend up to 200 feet in all directions despite any physical barriers that surround it.

Dimensional Slip	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CacklingPerceptorRaceTrait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Using its strange sight, a perceptor can spot folds in reality that allow it to move to a distant spot with a single step. It can also slide into strange dimensions that interact with the real world but do not cross it. The perceptor can cast dimension door at will. In addition, the perceptor can gain the benefits of improved invisibility at will. While this talent duplicates spell effects, it is not magical in nature. Instead, the perceptor manipulates reality in a manner that other creatures simply cannot perceive or understand. Activating either of this ability’s uses counts as a standard action.
