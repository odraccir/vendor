Spellcasting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AcolyteClassFeatures	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Acolytes gain access to a small number of divine spells. These blessings are much more limited in scope than a cleric's lists, as they tend to focus on daily necessities and conveniences rather than smiting evil. Acolytes prepare and cast spells as clerics. They use Wisdom to determine their spells' save DCs, the highest spell level they can cast, and any bonus spells they receive. If the acolyte has a 0 listed for a given level, add any bonus spells he receives to determine the total spells per day he can prepare and cast for that level. In essence, the acolyte cannot use spells of that level unless he gains bonus spells. Note that, unlike clerics, acolytes cannot spontaneously cast cure spells.
