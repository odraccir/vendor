Vampire Aversions	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The vampire gains the classic aversions of his kind. He cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and cannot enter an area laced with it. Similarly, he recoils from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These items don't harm the vampire -- they merely keep him at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature for the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay requires a standard action. Most vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship. (A vampire that has a natural swim speed may freely cross running water and is quite comfortable in water of any kind). Vampires are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may freely enter public places, since such areas are by definition open to all.	KEY:Vampire Aversions ~ Vampire																											SOURCEPAGE:SP
Children of the Night	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world. Starting at 5th level, a vampire can call forth a rat swarm, a bat swarm, or 1d3 wolves as a standard action once per day. The creature or creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.

Damage Reduction	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A vampire's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Vulnerability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Vulnerability	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A 5th-level or higher vampire exposed to direct sunlight is disoriented. While in this condition, he can take only a single move action or attack action in a round, and 3 full rounds of such exposure destroy it utterly. Similarly, immersing a typical vampire in running water robs it of onefifth of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the fifth round of immersion. (A vampire with a natural swim speed is not harmed by immersion in running water.)

Fast Healing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Beginning at 6th level, a vampire heals 1 point of damage each round so long as he has at least 1 hit point, whether or not he is resting in his coffin. A living vampire reduced to fewer than 0 hp or an undead vampire reduced to 0 hit points is automatically forced into gaseous form (if he still has uses of that ability available) and must retreat to his coffin (see the Coffin Sanctuary, above).

Energy Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:any living creature hit by his slam attack (or any other natural weapon he might possess) gains one negative level. For each negative level so bestowed, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points. He can use his energy drain ability once per round.

Create Spawn	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a 7th-level or higher vampire's energy drain attack rises as a vampire spawn (see the Monster Manual) 1d4 days after burial. If the vampire instead drains the victim's Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or fewer HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains so enslaved until its master's destruction. At any given time, a vampire may have enslaved spawn whose Hit Dice total no more than his own.
